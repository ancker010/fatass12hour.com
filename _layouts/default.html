				<h2>COVID-19 UPDATE</h2>
			</header>	
			<p>Until last week, I was planning to cancel Big Jay's Ultra Cycling Challenge for 2020.  Coronavirus, a lack or Rotary volunteers, travel restrictions in Illinois and businesses being forced to close their doors were all factors working against the race.  With the absence of any races or even group rides, my training had dwindled to a point where I was considering myself a recreational cyclist and I'm certain I wasn't the only one who had this issue.  However, a friend of mine (who is instrumental in the bike race), contacted me last week and asked what was going to happen to the race.  I told him I was planning to cancel, but felt terrible about it.  He told me that moving the race back to the original mid-July date would help everybody.  Not only would it give the ultra-cycling community a badly needed reason to train, but it would also help the good people of Nepal.  Hearing this, I reconsidered everything.
As of April 30, Big Jay's Ultra Cycling Challenge will take place on July 18.  The start location may change, but will stay in Mahomet with the same format as the previous 11 years.  
However, if restrictions/group meetings are still in place one month prior to the race (June 18), it will be cancelled for 2020.  So, check out the website for the latest info.
